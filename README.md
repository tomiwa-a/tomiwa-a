### Hey.

I'm **Tomiwa**, a software engineer who loves building **backend systems** and digging into how things work under the hood.  
Right now, I’m spending most of my time on:  
- building my own **database** from scratch  
- experimenting with **microservice apps** in different languages (Go, Node.js, Golang, Java…)  
- working on **enterprise-level backends** with queues, workers, and scaling  

---

### 🔧 Tech I use
- **Languages:** Go, Node.js (TypeScript/JavaScript), Python, C++
- **Databases & Storage:** PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Redis, ElasticSearch  
- **Infra & Tools:** Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Git, event-driven systems  

---

### 🌱 What’s next
Learning more about **distributed systems, compilers, and large-scale infra**.  
Always curious about how to push backend engineering further.
